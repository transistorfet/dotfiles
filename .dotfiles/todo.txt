* text file managers to try:
    - ranger
	- ranger and yazi have a similar interface/ui (which I like, even though it's not treeview)
    - broot
    - nnn
	- by default it's using the gnome file associations, which are different from the kde ones I use.  Not sure if this is configurable
    - mc
    - vifm

    - lf

    - yazi
	- I want to like it, but the d for delete is too easy for me to accidentally press, and it doesn't prompt on delete.  Might be configurable
	- it's vim-like but you're always in insert mode instead of command mode!?! it's kind of infuriating
	- it does have nice previews though, and emoji
    - bt
	- simple, but I do like the treeview
	- still early development, no mouse support atm

    - xplr
	- it's a shell integration, it just returns a path.  I don't think I have it installed correctly
    - clifm
	- couldn't get it to compile yet
    - lfm
	- not maintained anymore?
    - wcm
	- segfaults


* add links to references to the cheat sheets

* try using neovim instead of gvim
* try using Zed instead of gvim
* try wezterm and alacritty
* try using nushell instead of bash
* try sway

* try using zellij instead of tmux??


TMUX:
    * learn the extra copy paste commands


VIM:
    * if you open a txt file, then "spell" is enabled for all files
    * can you set focus follows mouse in vim or is that only for gui?
    * should you use undotree instead of mundo?


NEOVIM:
    * selecting text doesn't auto-copy to the middle click buffer like gvim does, `set guioptions+=a` (super annoying)
    * the workaround, vmap <LeftRelease> "*ygv is yanking to both "* and "" registers, which defeats the point...
    * cursor blinks in gvim but not neovim (not sure if want or not, but it should be configurable)


NEOVIM-QT:
    * in QT the mouse doesn't change when hovering over a status bar like gvim does
    * unable to copy command line in any way (can use terminal copy in nvim)


NUSHELL:
    * the tripping point for me so far has been a lack of bash completion support, so apt-get install in particular doesn't autocomplete

KITTY:
    * I don't like kitty because it doesn't have scrollbars and the developer said he didn't want it and closed the ticket right away
