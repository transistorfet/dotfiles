* text file managers to try:
    - broot
    - xplr
    - nnn
    - ranger
    - mc
    - lf
    - vifm
    - bt
    - lfm
    - wcm

    - clifm
	- couldn't get it to compile yet
    - yazi
	- I want to like it, but the d for delete is too easy for me to accidentally press, and it doesn't prompt on delete.  Might be configurable
	- it's vim-like but you're always in insert mode instead of command mode!?! it's kind of infuriating
	- it does have nice previews though, and emoji

* add links to references to the cheat sheets

* try using neovim instead of gvim
* try using Zed instead of gvim
* try wezterm and alacritty
* try using nushell instead of bash
* try sway

* try using zellij instead of tmux??


TMUX:
    * learn the extra copy paste commands


VIM:
    * if you open a txt file, then "spell" is enabled for all files
    * can you set focus follows mouse in vim or is that only for gui?
    * should you use undotree instead of mundo?


NEOVIM:
    * selecting text doesn't auto-copy to the middle click buffer like gvim does, `set guioptions+=a` (super annoying)
    * the workaround, vmap <LeftRelease> "*ygv is yanking to both "* and "" registers, which defeats the point...
    * cursor blinks in gvim but not neovim (not sure if want or not, but it should be configurable)


NEOVIM-QT:
    * in QT the mouse doesn't change when hovering over a status bar like gvim does
    * unable to copy command line in any way (can use terminal copy in nvim)


NUSHELL:
    * the tripping point for me so far has been a lack of bash completion support, so apt-get install in particular doesn't autocomplete

KITTY:
    * I don't like kitty because it doesn't have scrollbars and the developer said he didn't want it and closed the ticket right away
