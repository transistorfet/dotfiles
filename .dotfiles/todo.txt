* add links to references to the cheat sheets

* try using kitty as your daily terminal emulator
* try warp, wezterm, other terminal emulators
* try using neovim instead of gvim
* try using nushell instead of bash

* try using zellij instead of tmux??


TMUX:
    * learn the extra copy paste commands


VIM:
    * if you open a txt file, then "spell" is enabled for all files
    * can you set focus follows mouse in vim or is that only for gui?
    * should you use undotree instead of mundo?


NEOVIM:
    * selecting text doesn't auto-copy to the middle click buffer like gvim does (super annoying)
    * cursor blinks in gvim but not neovim (not sure if want or not)


NEOVIM-QT:
    * in QT the mouse doesn't change when hovering over a status bar like gvim does
