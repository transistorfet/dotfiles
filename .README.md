Alternate Programs To Try
-------------------------

* Terminal Emulators:
    - konsole (current default)
        * lots of good features without being too heavy feeling
        * it doesn't run on MacOS, which I use for work
    - alactritty
    - wezterm
    - kitty
        * no scroll bars, and developer has no interest in implementing them
    - stterm
        * it doesn't support scrollback without a patch, and that's a critical feature for me, but is otherwise really lightweight
    - warp
        * no linux support

* Shells:
    - bash (current default)
    - nushell
        * still in early development, but impressive
    - zsh
        * I don't like the double tab autofill behaviour and haven't tried configuring it differently
    - fish
        * it tries to do too much for me and can be distracting

* Editors:
    - vim (current default, but trying out neovim)
    - neovim
        * fonts don't display the same, but that's partly because they're broken in vim
        * no prompt as soon as file changed on disk (fixed with noautoread and autocmd whenever focus changes)
        * nvim-qt as frontend doesn't have as many little features as gvim
            - guioptions=a which automatically yanks text selected with the mouse to the '*' register
            - mouse cursor doesn't change shape when hovering over interactive ui elements like in gvim
              (vertical bar cursor in text area, up/down arrow cursor over status bars that can be moved)

* Window Managers:
    - i3 (current default)
    - sway for Wayland
        * last time I tried to run Wayland/Sway, it wouldn't start, likely because I'm also using the nvidia drivers,
          which apparently don't play well with sway, but I'm happy with X11/Xorg, so I'll stick with i3 for now

* Terminal Multiplexers:
    - tmux (current default)
        * at first I didn't like the status bar (even though it can be turned off) but I used to use a multiplexer
          mostly through my phone when out of the house and on poor internet connections, but now that at work, I have
          to do all my coding and building on a remote machine through SSH, I prefer the extra features it has,
          especially the status bar
    - zellij
    - screen
        * I used to use it but switched to tmux, for the extra features
