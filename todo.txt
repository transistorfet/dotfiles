* add links to references to the cheat sheets


TMUX:
    * need to figure out how to copy and paste through ssh with mouse on
    * there are some copy/paste commands that might be useful with iTerm2


VIM:
    * need something for scrolling horizontally
    * can you set focus follows mouse in vim or is that only for gui?

    Alternate Plugins:
	* should you use fzf instead of Ctrl-P
	* lightline instead of airline?
	* undotree instead of mundo?

NEOVIM:
    * GuiScrollBar needs to be properly activated
    * window title is not the filename (NeoVim as a title is useless if I have multiple copies open)
