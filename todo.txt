* add links to references to the cheat sheets

* i sort of have work arounds for copy/paste, except copying text from vim through tmux through ssh into the host clipboard


TMUX:
    * need to figure out how to copy and paste through ssh with mouse on
    * there are some copy/paste commands that might be useful with iTerm2


VIM:
    * need to think about scrolling a bit more depending on how it works on Mac/iTerm2 (should shift or ctrl activate horizontal
      scrolling, and what should the vertical scroll behaviour be with the same modified?)
    * should the amount be larger for the arrow keys (like 40)? particularly for console over ssh which is a bit slow to scroll

    * can you set focus follows mouse in vim or is that only for gui?

    Alternate Plugins:
        * should you use fzf instead of Ctrl-P
        * lightline instead of airline?
        * undotree instead of mundo?

NEOVIM:
    * GuiScrollBar needs to be properly activated
    * window title is not the filename (NeoVim as a title is useless if I have multiple copies open)
