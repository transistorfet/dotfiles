* add links to references to the cheat sheets


TMUX:
    * need to adjust so it works with tmux 3.0a
    * learn the extra copy paste commands


VIM:
    * if you open a txt file, then "spell" is enabled for all files
    * need to think about scrolling a bit more depending on how it works on Mac/iTerm2 (should shift or ctrl activate horizontal
      scrolling, and what should the vertical scroll behaviour be with the same modified?)

    * can you set focus follows mouse in vim or is that only for gui?

    Alternate Plugins:
        * should you use fzf instead of Ctrl-P
        * lightline instead of airline?
        * undotree instead of mundo?

NEOVIM:
    * GuiScrollBar needs to be properly activated
    * window title is not the filename (NeoVim as a title is useless if I have multiple copies open)
