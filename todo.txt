* add links to references to the cheat sheets

* think about changing your default terminal emulator:
    * kitty is nice but doesn't look quite right and I don't like the cursor, also uses its own xterm-kitty profile
    * alactritty??
    * konsole is great for my desktop, but not great over vnc
    * iterm2 is great for mac and nothing else
    * stterm doesn't support scrolling

TMUX:
    * learn the extra copy paste commands


VIM:
    * if you open a txt file, then "spell" is enabled for all files
    * can you set focus follows mouse in vim or is that only for gui?

    Alternate Plugins:
        * should you use fzf instead of Ctrl-P
        * lightline instead of airline?
        * undotree instead of mundo?

NEOVIM:
    * GuiScrollBar needs to be properly activated
    * window title is not the filename (NeoVim as a title is useless if I have multiple copies open)
